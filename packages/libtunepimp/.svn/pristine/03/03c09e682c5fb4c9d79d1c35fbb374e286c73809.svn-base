	Memory allocation errors have been fixed in $tp->getFileIds,
	$tp->getSupportedExtensions and $tr->getResults.  $tr->getResults
	is now implemented in pure XS.
	
	Because $tr->getResults now returns just plain, un-blessed hash
	references, the three "results" packages are obsolete, and have been
	removed (namely: MusicBrainz::Tunepimp::result::artist, ::album and
	::albumtrack).

	In $tp->setNotifyCallback and $tp->setStatusCallback, you now get the
	same error message regardless of "how wrong" the argument was.  (But
	don't use the callback interface anyway, it's not "safe").

	$track->getTRM always chopped the last character off.  Now fixed.
