version 0.4.0:

  - Added readMetadataNow flag to addFile
  - Added TPFileStatus argument to getNotification
  - Implemented a plug-in system
  - Switched out fstrcmp with astrcmp
  - Created seperate metadata reading class
  - Exposed new md_Compare function
  - Change metadata_t, artistresult_t, albumresult_t and albumtrackresult_t to use static 
    strings rather than dyanmic memory allocation
  - Tunepimp constructor now takes an optional pluginDir argument -- if this
    is specified then the given dir will be scanned for plugins and the 
    default plugin locations will be ignored. This argument is also exposed
    via tp_NewWithArgs()
  - Added mb_Similarity() function to expose astrcmp() to the outside world
  - Added support to plugins for reading duration seperate from decoding the
    file. 
  - Updated the python bidings for use with ctypes 0.9.x
  - Changed the python bindings to not throw errors on UTF-8 conversion problems
  - All strings going in and out of tunepimp must now be in UTF-8!!
  - A filename encoding can be specified for non-windows systems. UNICODE
    (wide chars) will be used for Windows.
  - The ID3 plugin now has TWO versions of id3tag -- one each for 2.3/2.4
  - positionInSet values are now read, preserved and written back to ID3v2 tags

version 0.3.0:

  - Clayton O'Neill wrote a FLAC component for tunepimp and added
    the %format specifier for renaming conventions
  - Added %type, %status, %year, %month, %day and %country format specifiers
  - Mattias Friedrich added documentation for the C binding
  - Dave Evans wrote a perl module for libtunepimp
  - Added CharToOem conversion for writing filenames to FAT drives
  - Fixed a problem where tags were getting unsynchronized which should not
    happen for 2.3 tags.
  - Defined MAX_EXTENSION_LEN for use with tp_GetSupportedExtensions
  - Added Python bindings for tunepimp
  - include files are now in include/tunepimp so that example programs can
    use the same include path for the tp_c header file.

version 0.2.1:

  - Imported the source code for the libid3tag library and:
      - Writes out version 2.3, but the code is really 2.4
        and its a mess, but it seems to work. I HATE ID3V2!!!
      - Uses XSOP tags for writing performer sort order  
  - Added support to tp_tagger for setting username and password
    and fixed buggy error reporting.
  - Added C language binding
  - Added support for specifying which characters are allowed in filenames.

version 0.2.0:

  - Dropped id3lib in favor of libid3tag from http://underbit.com
  - tp_tagger now has readline support if readline is installed
  - Writing id3v2 tags is no longer an option -- its now mandatory

version 0.1.0:

  - First public version, created from the guts of the MusicBrainz tagger and
    enhanced with the following features:

       o Improve support for various artist albums. Looking up VA albums works
         better, and there is a seperate VA file mask.
       o AlbumArtist is now written to tags, to keep make sure the VA/non-VA
         info is retained in the tags.
       o More naming file mask options:
          %sortname -- The sortname of the artist
          %num      -- The non zero padded track number
          %0num     -- The zero padded track number
          %abc      -- The first letter in the sortname of the artist.
          %abc2     -- The first two letters in the sortname of the artist.
          %abc3     -- The first three letters in the sortname of the artist.

          Example:
            
            %abc/%abc2/%sortname/%album/%0num-%track 
             
            gives 
            
            B/Be/Beatles, The/Help!/01-Help!.mp3

       o Allow all valid filesystem characters, now depends on OS
       o make sure that a track with no metadata does not show up as 100% 
       o Improve TRM collision handling 
           - Let the user set the accept/deny threshold
           - Indicate a collision and let the user pick the right one.
       o Strip tags before saving option 

  - The tagger example application 'tp_tagger' gets installed as the only
    usable application -- the application has no C wrapper yet.
